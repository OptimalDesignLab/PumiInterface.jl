airfoil.smb/airfoil.smd: NACA 0012 airfoil, airfoil surface 5, free stream 8,
                         chord length 1, free stream diameter 20, ~2700
                         elements

airfoil2_.smb/airfoil2.smd: NACA 0012 airfoil, airfoil surface 5, free stream
                            40, free stream diameter 20, ~2700 elements,
                            has trailing edge vertex

tri4x4.smb/.dmg: 4 x 4 mesh, square domain, -1 to 1, nothing periodic

UnitCube: contains a unit cube.  The mesh has ~1000 elements (that appears to
          be the smallest mesh SimModeler will generate).  All the geometry
          and mesh files are there.

UnitCubeCurve: contains a unit cube where 2 of the sides are bent inwards with
               a circular profile.  The mesh is quadratic.  All the geometry
               and mesh files are there.
