This file contains notes on the various mesh files used for testing.
This file was created some time after the repository was started, to not
all mesh files are present.

tet111_.smb: a unit cube consisting of 6 tets, fully periodic (used to test that the parallel code asserts when it should)

tet222_.smb: same as tet111, but 2 cubes in each direction, each cube subdivided into 6 tets

tet211_.smb: same as tet222, but 2 x 1 x 1 cubes
